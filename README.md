# Software Engineering Testing and Debugging Assignment

This repository contains the completed projects for various software engineering testing and debugging tasks. These tasks involved applying key software engineering principles to real-world programs from different application domains. Below is an overview of the projects I have completed.

## Key Projects Completed

### 1. **Testing Programs in Different Languages**
   - **Program Domains:** I selected three different programs from diverse application domains, each written in a different programming language.
   - **Test Suite Creation:** For each program, I created comprehensive test suites to identify edge cases and thoroughly evaluate functionality.
   - **Tools Used:**
     - **Fuzz Testing (AFL):** Automated test case generation to uncover vulnerabilities.
     - **EvoSuite:** Used to generate unit tests for Java programs, specifically for the JSoup library.

### 2. **White-box Testing**
   - **Concept:** Applied white-box testing to understand the internal structure of the programs.
   - **Techniques Used:**
     - Statement coverage
     - Branch coverage
     - Path coverage
   - This helped evaluate the effectiveness of the test suite and ensured comprehensive program coverage.

### 3. **Black-box Testing**
   - **Concept:** Conducted black-box testing, focusing on testing the programs without access to their internal structure.
   - **Techniques Applied:**
     - Randomized inputs
     - Boundary value testing
     - Equivalence class partitioning

### 4. **Mutation Testing**
   - **Objective:** Implemented a mutation testing tool in Python to evaluate the effectiveness of the existing test cases.
   - **Task:** Generated mutants of Python programs to assess how well the test suite identified faults.
   - **Tool Used:** Mutation testing helped to identify the quality of the test cases by creating small code mutations to test fault detection.

### 5. **Static Analysis Tools**
   - **Objective:** Applied static analysis tools to detect potential security issues, memory defects, and other problems in legacy codebases.
   - **Tools Used:**
     - **Infer (Facebook):** Detected issues like null pointer exceptions, resource leaks, and more.
     - **CodeSonar (GrammaTech):** Used for detecting complex security vulnerabilities and bugs in source code without executing it.

### 6. **Debugging Support Tools**
   - **Delta Debugging:** Utilized delta debugging to minimize test case sets that reproduce failures and narrow down the root cause of issues.
   - **Coverage-based Fault Localization:** Analyzed code coverage and execution paths to identify which lines were most likely responsible for test failures.

### 7. **Open-Source Contribution**
   - **Objective:** Contributed meaningful changes to an open-source project.
   - **Bonus Points:** My contribution was accepted by the project maintainers, earning bonus points for giving back to the open-source community.

## Key Learning Outcomes

- **Code Comprehension:** Gained practical experience in understanding and maintaining code that was written by others.
- **Testing Techniques:** Learned how to effectively apply different testing methodologies, such as white-box, black-box, and mutation testing.
- **Legacy Code Handling:** Gained experience working with complex legacy codebases, simulating real-world software engineering challenges.
- **Advanced Debugging:** Improved skills in using automated tools for debugging and fault localization.
- **Collaboration:** Worked in a pair-based setup, simulating teamwork and effective communication during software development.

## Tools and Resources Used

- **Fuzz Testing (AFL):** Automated the generation of test cases to identify vulnerabilities.
- **EvoSuite:** Used for generating unit tests for Java programs (JSoup library).
- **Mutation Testing Tool (Python):** Created mutants of Python programs to test the quality of existing test suites.
- **Static Analysis Tools (Infer & CodeSonar):** Used for detecting bugs and vulnerabilities in code without execution.
- **Open Source Contribution:** Contributed changes to an open-source project for bonus points.

## Conclusion

Through the completion of these projects, I gained valuable hands-on experience in software engineering testing and debugging. I applied various methodologies like white-box, black-box, and mutation testing, worked with legacy code, and used advanced tools for debugging and static analysis. Additionally, I contributed to open-source projects, enhancing my collaboration and practical skills. These experiences have significantly prepared me for real-world software engineering tasks and challenges.
